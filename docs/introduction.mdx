## What is Drevon?

Drevon is a CLI framework that transforms any directory into an **AI-native workspace**. One config file generates custom instructions for 8 different coding agents — with persistent memory, pluggable skills, and reusable prompts.

Your AI agents stop being stateless tools and start becoming **self-evolving collaborators** that remember context, learn patterns, and improve across sessions.

## The Problem

Every AI coding agent uses a different config format:

- Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`
- Cursor reads `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md`
- And 4 more agents, each with their own format...

Maintaining these manually is painful. When you switch agents or add a teammate who uses a different one, instructions get fragmented and context is lost between sessions.

## The Solution

  <Card title="Single Source of Truth" icon="file-code">
    One `drevon.config.json` compiles into every agent's native format. Edit once, every agent stays in sync.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent Memory" icon="brain">
    Agents read and write to memory files across sessions — building context that compounds over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable Skills" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Install capabilities from the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace. Skills are automatically injected into all agent configs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reusable Prompts" icon="terminal">
    Structured workflow templates for code review, debugging, feature implementation, and more.

## How It Works

```bash
npx drevon init
```

This single command:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detects your workspace">
    Automatically determines whether you need Hub mode (multi-project) or Project mode (single codebase).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configures your identity">
    Choose a preset (founder, developer, team, researcher) that defines how agents behave.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generates agent configs">
    Creates native config files for every agent you enable — Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Codex, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sets up memory & skills">
    Initializes the memory system and installs the bundled skill discovery tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The result: a workspace where every AI agent knows who you are, what you're building, and how to help — and gets better at it over time.
