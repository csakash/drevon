title: drevon upgrade
description: Migrate your config to the latest schema version.
---

## Usage

```bash
drevon upgrade
```

## Description

Applies sequential migrations to bring your `drevon.config.json` from its current `version` to the latest schema version. Currently the latest version is `1`.

## When to Use

Run `drevon upgrade` after updating the Drevon CLI to a new major version that includes config schema changes. The command will:

1. Read your current config
2. Detect the version
3. Apply any necessary migrations
4. Write the updated config
5. Prompt you to run `drevon sync` to regenerate agent configs

## Current Status

<Info>
  The migration framework is in place but no migrations are needed yet (config version 1 is the latest). This command is infrastructure for future schema evolution.
</Info>

```bash
$ drevon upgrade
Config is already at the latest version (1).
```
