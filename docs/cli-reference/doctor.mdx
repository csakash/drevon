## Usage

```bash
drevon doctor
```

## Description

Runs a comprehensive diagnostic check on your workspace, verifying that all expected files exist and are in good shape.

## Checks Performed

| Check | What It Verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Agent configs** | Each enabled agent's output files exist on disk |
| **Memory files** | All configured memory files are present |
| **Skills lock** | `skills-lock.json` exists and is valid |
| **Prompts directory** | `.drevon/prompts/` directory exists |

## Output Example

```
  Running diagnostics...

  Agents:
    ✓ copilot — .github/copilot-instructions.md exists
    ✓ claude — CLAUDE.md exists
    ✗ cursor — .cursor/rules/core.mdc missing

  Memory:
    ✓ user.md exists
    ✓ projects.md exists
    ✓ systems.md exists
    ✓ log.md exists

  Skills:
    ✓ skills-lock.json exists

  Prompts:
    ✓ .drevon/prompts/ exists

  1 issue found. Run 'drevon sync' to fix.
```

## Fixing Issues

Most issues can be resolved by running:

```bash
drevon sync
```

If files are missing from the memory system, you may need to re-initialize:

```bash
# Re-create memory files only
drevon init
```
