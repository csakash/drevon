description: Install, remove, list, and sync skills from the skills.sh ecosystem.
---

## Usage

```bash
drevon skill <action> [arguments]
```

## Actions

### skill add

Install a skill from the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace.

```bash
drevon skill add <source>
```

**Source formats:**

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `owner/repo` | `drevon skill add browser-use/browser-use` |
| `owner/repo/skill` | `drevon skill add coreyhaines31/marketingskills/copywriting` |
| Pasted from skills.sh | `drevon skill add "npx skills add browser-use/browser-use --skill browser-use"` |

**What happens:**
1. Parses and sanitizes the source URL
2. Checks if the skill is already installed
3. Runs `npx -y skills add <repo>` to download
4. Copies from `.agents/skills/` to `.drevon/skills/`
5. Reads `SKILL.md` for description
6. Updates `skills-lock.json`
7. Runs `drevon sync` to inject into all agent configs

<Tip>
  You can paste install commands directly from skills.sh — Drevon strips the `npx skills add` prefix and `--skill` flags automatically.
</Tip>

### skill remove

Remove an installed skill.

```bash
drevon skill remove <name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
drevon skill remove browser-use
```

Deletes the skill directory, removes it from `skills-lock.json`, and recompiles all agent configs.

---

### skill list

Show all installed skills.

```bash
drevon skill list
```

**Output:**
```
Installed skills:

  find-skills     Helps users discover and install agent skills
  browser-use     Control web browsers for research and testing
  copywriting     Conversion copywriting guidelines
```

---

### skill sync

Re-sync skills into agent configs. Also migrates any skills from the legacy `.agents/skills/` directory to `.drevon/skills/`.

```bash
drevon skill sync
```

This is useful when:
- Skills were installed outside of Drevon (e.g., via `npx skills add` directly)
- You need to repair the skills-lock.json
- Agent configs are out of sync with installed skills
