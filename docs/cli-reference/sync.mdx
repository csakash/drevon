description: Regenerate all agent config files from drevon.config.json.
---

## Usage

```bash
drevon sync
```

## Description

Reads `drevon.config.json`, resolves all skills and memory settings, then regenerates every enabled agent's config file. Only changed files are written — unchanged files are skipped to avoid Git noise.

## What It Does

1. Loads and validates `drevon.config.json`
2. Migrates any skills from `.agents/skills/` → `.drevon/skills/` (backwards compatibility)
3. Reads `skills-lock.json` for installed skills
4. For each enabled agent, generates the native config file
5. Diffs against existing files — only writes changes
6. Reports what was created, updated, or unchanged

## Output

```
  ● Syncing agent configs...

  ✓ .github/copilot-instructions.md (updated)
  ✓ CLAUDE.md (updated)
  ✓ .cursor/rules/core.mdc (unchanged)
  ✓ .cursor/rules/memory.mdc (unchanged)
  ✓ .cursor/rules/skills.mdc (updated)
  ✓ AGENTS.md (updated)

  Sync complete — 4 updated, 2 unchanged
```

## When to Run

Run `drevon sync` after any of these changes:

- Editing `drevon.config.json` (identity, instructions, agent settings)
- Installing or removing a skill
- Adding or modifying memory files
- Creating or deleting prompts

<Tip>
  It's safe to run `drevon sync` frequently — it's idempotent and only writes files that actually changed.
