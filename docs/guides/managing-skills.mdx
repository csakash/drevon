## Finding Skills

### Skills.sh Marketplace

Browse the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace for community-built skills. Skills are ranked by installs, and each listing shows compatibility, description, and install commands.

### Using the Find-Skills Skill

Every Drevon workspace comes with `find-skills` pre-installed. Simply ask your AI agent:

> "Find me a skill for working with PDFs"

The agent will search skills.sh and recommend relevant options.

### By Category

| Category | Popular Skills |
|----------|---------------|
| **Browser** | `browser-use/browser-use` |
| **Documents** | `nicobailon/pdf` |
| **Marketing** | `coreyhaines31/marketingskills` |
| **Design** | `ui-ux-pro-max`, `tailwind-design-system` |
| **Video** | `florentinmayer/remotion` |
| **SEO** | `seo-audit` |

## Installing Skills

### Basic Install

```bash
drevon skill add browser-use/browser-use
```

### From Multi-Skill Repos

Some repositories contain multiple skills:

```bash
# Install a specific skill from a multi-skill repo
drevon skill add coreyhaines31/marketingskills/copywriting
```

### Copy-Paste from Skills.sh

You can paste the full install command from the skills.sh website:

```bash
drevon skill add "npx skills add browser-use/browser-use --skill browser-use"
```

Drevon automatically sanitizes the input, stripping the `npx skills add` prefix and `--skill` flags.

## Evaluating Skills

Before installing a skill, consider:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read the SKILL.md">
    Every skill contains a `SKILL.md` that defines when it activates, what it does, and how it instructs the agent. Review this to ensure it aligns with your needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check install count">
    Skills with higher install counts on skills.sh are generally more reliable and well-maintained.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test in isolation">
    Install the skill, run `drevon sync`, then test with your agent to verify it works as expected before relying on it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Watch for conflicts">
    If two skills give conflicting instructions, agents may behave inconsistently. Review installed skills periodically for overlaps.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Removing Skills

```bash
drevon skill remove browser-use
```

This:
1. Deletes `.drevon/skills/browser-use/`
2. Removes from `skills-lock.json`
3. Runs `drevon sync` to update all agent configs

## Syncing After External Changes

If you install a skill directly via `npx skills add` (not through Drevon), the skill lands in `.agents/skills/`. Run:

```bash
drevon skill sync
```

This migrates skills from `.agents/skills/` → `.drevon/skills/` and updates the lock file.

## Skill Packs

Drevon defines curated skill collections for quick setup:

## Creating Custom Skills

A skill is just a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.drevon/skills/my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Custom skill for my workflow
---

# My Custom Skill

## Instructions

After creating it, register in `skills-lock.json` or run `drevon skill sync`.
