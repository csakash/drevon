## What You'll Build

In this guide, you'll create a **hub-mode workspace** from scratch — complete with memory, skills, and multiple agents configured. By the end, you'll have a self-evolving workspace that works with any AI coding agent.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- At least one AI coding agent installed (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude Code)

## Step 1: Create the Workspace

```bash
mkdir my-ai-workspace && cd my-ai-workspace
npx drevon init
```

The wizard starts. Here's what to choose:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mode → Hub">
    Since this is a new empty directory, Drevon suggests Hub mode. Accept it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name → my-ai-workspace">
    Uses the directory name. Press Enter to accept.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identity → Founder">
    Choose "Founder" for maximum autonomy. The agent will take initiative and move fast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agents → Copilot + Claude">
    Select at least two agents to see Drevon's multi-agent power.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Memory → Yes">
    Enable memory for persistent cross-session context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Starter Prompts → Yes">
    Install the 5 starter workflow templates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Explore What Was Created

```bash
drevon status
```

You should see:
- Mode: `hub`
- Identity: `founder-agent`
- 2 agents enabled with health checks
- 4 memory files
- 1 skill (find-skills)
- 5 prompts

Let's look at the structure:

```bash
ls -la
```

```
drevon.config.json
.drevon/
  memory/
    user.md
    projects.md
    systems.md
    log.md
  skills/
    find-skills/
  prompts/
    _index.md
    code-review.md
    debug.md
    new-feature.md
    refactor.md
    write-tests.md
workspace/
.github/copilot-instructions.md
CLAUDE.md
```

## Step 3: Install Your First Skill

Let's add browser automation capability:

```bash
drevon skill add browser-use/browser-use
```

Verify it's installed:

```bash
drevon skill list
```

## Step 4: Add a Custom Instruction

Edit `drevon.config.json` to add a project-specific rule:

```json
{
  "instructions": [
    {
      "id": "memory-protocol",
      "title": "Memory Protocol",
      "content": "Read all files in .drevon/memory/ at the start of every session. Write to them after significant actions.",
      "alwaysApply": true
    },
    {
      "id": "tech-stack",
      "title": "Tech Stack",
      "content": "This workspace uses TypeScript, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel for deployment. Always use these technologies unless explicitly told otherwise.",
      "alwaysApply": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Then sync:

```bash
drevon sync
```

## Step 5: Start Your First Project

Create a project folder:

```bash
mkdir workspace/my-first-project
```

Now open the workspace in your editor and start a conversation with your AI agent. The agent will:

1. **Read memory files** to understand the workspace context
2. **Follow your identity rules** (founder-agent posture)
3. **Know about installed skills** (browser-use, find-skills)
4. **Use your custom instructions** (tech stack preferences)

## Step 6: Verify the Self-Evolution Loop

After your first session, check if the agent updated memory:

```bash
cat .drevon/memory/log.md
```

You should see new entries documenting what the agent did. Over time, these memory files become an invaluable knowledge base.
