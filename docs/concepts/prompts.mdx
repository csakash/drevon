## Overview

Prompts are reusable workflow templates stored in `.drevon/prompts/`. They provide structured, step-by-step guidance for common development tasks like code review, debugging, and feature implementation.

## How Prompts Work

Prompts are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. When prompts are enabled, agents are informed about available prompts and can reference them when a matching task arises.

```markdown
---
title: Code Review
description: Thorough code review checklist covering correctness, security, and performance
tags: [review, quality]
---

## Workflow

1. **Understand** — Read the code and understand its purpose
2. **Correctness** — Verify logic, edge cases, error handling
3. **Security** — Check for vulnerabilities, input validation
...
```

## Starter Prompts

When you run `drevon init` and opt into starter prompts, you get 5 production-ready templates:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code Review" icon="magnifying-glass">
    A 7-section code review checklist:
    1. **Understanding** — Read and understand the code's purpose
    2. **Correctness** — Verify logic and edge cases
    3. **Security** — Check for vulnerabilities
    4. **Performance** — Identify bottlenecks
    5. **Readability** — Assess code clarity
    6. **Testing** — Evaluate test coverage
    7. **Documentation** — Check docs and comments
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debug" icon="bug">
    A 7-step debugging workflow:
    1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the exact issue
    2. **Isolate** — Narrow down the cause
    3. **Understand** — Analyze the root cause
    4. **Hypothesize** — Form a theory
    5. **Fix** — Implement the solution
    6. **Verify** — Confirm the fix works
    7. **Document** — Record the issue and fix
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New Feature" icon="plus">
    A 7-step feature implementation workflow:
    1. **Requirements** — Clarify what needs to be built
    2. **Design** — Plan the architecture
    3. **Plan** — Break into tasks
    4. **Implement** — Write the code
    5. **Test** — Verify correctness
    6. **Review** — Self-review before submission
    7. **Document** — Update docs and changelog
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refactor" icon="wrench">
    A 7-step safe refactoring methodology:
    1. **Identify** — Find the code smell or issue
    2. **Safety Net** — Ensure tests exist
    3. **Plan** — Define the refactoring strategy
    4. **Execute Incrementally** — Small, testable steps
    5. **Common Refactors** — Pattern-specific guidance
    6. **Verify** — Run tests after each step
    7. **Document** — Record what changed and why
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Write Tests" icon="flask-vial">
    A 7-section test writing methodology:
    1. **Identify** — What needs tests
    2. **AAA Structure** — Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
    3. **Happy Path** — Standard use cases
    4. **Edge Cases** — Boundary conditions
    5. **Error Paths** — Failure scenarios
    6. **Organization** — Test structure and naming
    7. **Avoid Mistakes** — Common testing anti-patterns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Custom Prompts

### Via CLI

```bash
drevon prompt create my-workflow
```

This creates a scaffolded prompt at `.drevon/prompts/my-workflow.md`:

```markdown
---
title: My Workflow
description: ""
tags: []
---

## Steps

1.
```

### Manual Creation

Create any `.md` file in `.drevon/prompts/`:

```markdown
---
title: API Endpoint
description: Step-by-step guide for creating a new REST API endpoint
tags: [api, backend, rest]
---

## Workflow

### 1. Define the Route
- Choose RESTful path and HTTP method
- Define request/response schemas with Zod

### 2. Implement Controller
- Parse and validate input
- Call service layer
- Return structured response

### 3. Add Tests
- Unit test the service logic
- Integration test the endpoint
- Test error cases
```

## Listing Prompts

```bash
drevon prompt list
```

Output:
```
Available prompts:

  code-review     Thorough code review checklist
  debug           Structured debugging workflow
  new-feature     Feature implementation guide
  refactor        Safe refactoring methodology
  write-tests     Test writing methodology
  api-endpoint    Step-by-step guide for creating a new REST API endpoint
```

## Prompt Index

Drevon auto-generates a `.drevon/prompts/_index.md` file — a table of contents linking to all available prompts with their titles and descriptions. This index is regenerated whenever you create or delete prompts.

## Self-Evolution Through Prompts

One of Drevon's key principles is **self-evolution**: agents are instructed to create new prompts when they notice they're performing the same multi-step workflow repeatedly.

For example, if you frequently ask an agent to set up a new React component with tests and Storybook, the agent should eventually create a `new-component.md` prompt that captures that workflow — making future instances faster and more consistent.

<Tip>
  Review `.drevon/prompts/` periodically to see what workflows your agents have created. You may find useful patterns you didn't explicitly design.
