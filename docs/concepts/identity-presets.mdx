title: Identity Presets
description: Pre-configured personality templates that define how your AI agents behave.
---

## Overview

Identity presets are pre-built configurations that define an agent's **role**, **behavior**, and **posture**. They determine how agents approach tasks, communicate, and make decisions.

Choose a preset during `drevon init` or set it via the `--template` flag:

```bash
npx drevon init --template developer
```

## Available Presets

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Founder">
    **Best for:** Startup founders, generalists, solo builders

    ```json
    {
      "role": "founder-agent",
      "description": "High-autonomy AI assistant for a startup founder",
      "posture": "Take initiative. Don't ask for permission on obvious decisions. Move fast, ship things, document what you do.",
      "capabilities": ["product", "engineering", "design", "marketing", "content"]
    }

    }
    ```

    **Behavior characteristics:**
    - Follows established patterns and conventions

    ```json
    {
      "role": "research-assistant",
      "description": "Thorough research and analysis assistant",
      "posture": "Be thorough and methodical. Cite sources. Question assumptions. Present multiple perspectives before recommending.",
      "capabilities": ["research", "analysis", "writing", "synthesis"]
    }

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Identity

You can fully customize the identity in `drevon.config.json`:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "role": "backend-specialist",
    "description": "Expert backend engineer focused on distributed systems",
    "posture": "Design for scale. Write defensive code. Always consider failure modes. Prefer proven patterns over novel approaches.",
    "capabilities": ["backend", "databases", "infrastructure", "security"]
  }
}
```

After editing, run `drevon sync` to update all agent configs.

## How Identity Affects Agents

The identity fields are injected into each agent's config as a prominent section:

```markdown
## Identity & Operating Mode

You are a **backend-specialist** — Expert backend engineer focused on distributed systems

**Default operating posture:**
Design for scale. Write defensive code. Always consider failure modes.
Prefer proven patterns over novel approaches.
```

This appears near the top of every agent's instruction file, ensuring it sets the tone for all interactions.

<Info>
  The `capabilities` array is informational — it helps agents understand their expected domain coverage but doesn't restrict what they can do.
