title: Memory Files Reference
description: Complete reference for all memory file templates.
---

## Overview

Memory files are markdown templates that agents read and write to maintain context across sessions. The specific files depend on the workspace mode.

## Hub Mode Files

### user.md

Stores user preferences, communication style, and decisions.

```markdown
# User Preferences & Profile

## Communication Style
<!-- How the user likes to interact -->

## Confirmed Preferences
<!-- Decisions the user has explicitly made -->

## Feedback & Reactions
| Date | What | Reaction |
|------|------|----------|

## Decisions Made
<!-- Significant choices made with or by the user -->
```

**Update when:** User expresses a preference or makes a decision.
**Write mode:** Update the relevant section in place.

---

### projects.md

Registry of all projects in the workspace.

```markdown
# Project Registry

All active and completed projects in `workspace/`.

## Active Projects
<!-- ### project-name
- **Folder:** workspace/project-name/
- **Status:** active | completed | paused
- **Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Summary:** one-line description -->

## Completed Projects
```

**Update when:** A project is created, updated, or completed.
**Write mode:** Update the relevant entry or add a new one.

---

### systems.md

Infrastructure, systems, and conventions record.

```markdown
# Systems & Infrastructure

Persistent record of systems, conventions, and infrastructure.
Update when a new system is created or changed.
```

**Update when:** A new system is created or an existing one changes.
**Write mode:** Update the relevant entry or add a new one.

---

### log.md

Chronological action log — the activity journal.

```markdown
# Action Log

Chronological record of significant actions. Append only — never delete.

### YYYY-MM-DD — title
**Action:** What was done
**Outcome:** What resulted
```

**Update when:** After every significant action.
**Write mode:** Append only (newest at bottom). Format: `### YYYY-MM-DD — title`

---

## Project Mode Files

### context.md

Project overview, architecture, and key information.

```markdown
# Project Context

## Overview
<!-- One-paragraph project description -->

## Architecture
<!-- High-level architecture description -->

## Key Files
<!-- Important files and their purposes -->

## Dependencies
<!-- Key dependencies and why they're used -->
```

**Update when:** Tech stack, architecture, or project scope changes.
**Write mode:** Update the relevant section in place.

---

### decisions.md

ADR-style technical decision records.

```markdown
# Technical Decisions

Architecture Decision Records. Append new decisions, never modify old ones.

<!-- ### NNN — Title
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Context:** What prompted this decision
- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Rationale:** Why this option was chosen
- **Alternatives:** What else was considered -->
```

**Update when:** A technical decision is made.
**Write mode:** Append a new numbered record.

---

### patterns.md

Code patterns, conventions, and anti-patterns.

```markdown
# Code Patterns & Conventions

Established patterns in this codebase.

## Naming Conventions
## File Structure
## Error Handling Patterns
## Testing Patterns
## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)
```

**Update when:** A new pattern is established or an existing one changes.
**Write mode:** Update the relevant section or add a new one.

---

### log.md (Project Mode)

Same format as hub mode:

```markdown
# Action Log

Chronological record of significant actions. Append only — never delete.
```

## Memory Protocol

Both modes include a **memory protocol** in agent instructions that tells agents:

1. **Read** all memory files at the start of every session
2. **Write** after significant actions
3. **Be specific and factual** — memory should be useful to a future session with zero context
4. **Create reusable prompts** when performing the same multi-step workflow repeatedly (self-evolution)

## Custom Memory Files

Add custom files via the `customFiles` config option:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "enabled": true,
    "directory": ".drevon/memory",
    "files": ["user.md", "projects.md", "systems.md", "log.md"],
    "customFiles": ["roadmap.md", "competitors.md"]
  }
}
```

Custom files must be created manually — Drevon only creates the standard template files.
