## Overview

Cline reads instructions from `.clinerules` in the repository root. Drevon generates this as a standard markdown file.

## Output File

```
.clinerules
```

## Enabling

```bash
drevon add-agent cline
```

Or in `drevon.config.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "cline": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Agent-Specific Settings

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "cline": {
      "enabled": true,
      "extraInstructions": [
        "Always ask before modifying files outside the src/ directory",
        "Use the file tree view to understand project structure first"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- [Cline](https://github.com/clinebot/cline) VS Code extension installed
- `.clinerules` in the repository root (Drevon handles this)
