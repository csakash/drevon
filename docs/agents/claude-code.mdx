title: Claude Code
description: Drevon's adapter for Anthropic's Claude Code agent.
---

## Overview

Claude Code reads project instructions from `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root. Drevon generates this file with your full config plus Claude-specific features like `allowedCommands`.

## Output File

```
CLAUDE.md
```

## Special Features

### Allowed Commands

Claude Code has a command execution permission system. Drevon automatically generates an `allowedCommands` section:

```markdown
## Allowed Commands

The following commands are pre-approved for use without user confirmation:

- `git`
- `npm`
- `npx`
- `node`
- `python3`
```

Configure in `drevon.config.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "claude": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedCommands": ["git", "npm", "npx", "node", "python3", "docker"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  Only add commands you trust Claude to run autonomously. Each listed command can be executed without confirmation prompts.
</Warning>

## Enabling

```bash
drevon add-agent claude
```

When added via CLI, default `allowedCommands` (`git`, `npm`, `npx`, `node`, `python3`) are automatically configured.

## Agent-Specific Settings

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "claude": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedCommands": ["git", "npm", "npx", "node", "python3"],
      "extraInstructions": [
        "Always explain your reasoning before making changes",
        "Prefer small, focused commits"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root (Drevon handles this)
